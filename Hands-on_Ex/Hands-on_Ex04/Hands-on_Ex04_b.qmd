# Learning Outcome

-  ggstatsplot package to create visual graphics with rich statistical information

-  performance package to visualise model diagnostics

-  parameters package to visualise model parameters

# Getting Started

## Installing and launching R packages

In this exercise, ggstatsplot and tidyverse will be used.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggstatsplot, tidyverse)
```
## Importing data
```{r}
exam <- read_csv("Exam_data.csv")
```
## One-sample test: gghistostats() method

In the code chunk below, [gghistostats()](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/gghistostats.html) is used to to build an visual of one-sample test on English scores.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)

gghistostats(
  data = exam,
  x = ENGLISH,
  type = "bayes",
  test.value = 60,
  xlab = "English scores"
)
```
## Unpacking the Bayes Factor

- A Bayes factor is the ratio of the likelihood of one particular hypothesis to the likelihood of another. It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.

- That’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.

- When we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. Null Hypothesis (H0): The true mean of the science scores is equal to the test value of 60. Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The true mean of the science scores is not equal to 60.   

- [k log(n)- 2log(L(θ̂))](https://www.statisticshowto.com/bayesian-information-criterion/): L(θ̂) represents the likelihood of the model tested, given your data, when evaluated at maximum likelihood values of θ. 

## How to interpret Bayes Factor

A Bayes Factor can be any positive number. One of the most common interpretations is this one—first proposed by Harold Jeffereys (1961) and slightly modified by Lee and Wagenmakers in 2013:

Statistical Annotations:

- log_e(BF_01) = 2.12: This is the natural logarithm of the Bayes Factor (BF) comparing the null hypothesis (science scores = 60) to the alternative hypothesis. A Bayes Factor greater than 1 indicates evidence against the null, and the value here suggests that the data provide evidence against the null hypothesis H0 (since log_e(2.12) > 0).
- Δ_posterior mean = 1.12: This indicates the difference between the sample mean and the test value (60), suggesting the average score is higher than the test value.
- 95% CI: This confidence interval shows the range of values within which the true mean score lies with 95% probability, according to the posterior distribution.
- JZS = 0.71: This likely refers to the magnitude of the difference between groups or conditions.

## Two-sample mean test: ggbetweenstats()

In the code chunk below, [ggbetweenstats()](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/ggbetweenstats.html) is used to build a visual for two-sample mean test of Maths scores by gender.

```{r}
ggbetweenstats(
  data = exam,
  x = GENDER, 
  y = MATHS,
  type = "np",
  messages = FALSE
)
```
## Oneway ANOVA Test: ggbetweenstats() method

In the code chunk below, [ggbetweenstats](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/ggbetweenstats.html) is used to build a visual for One-way ANOVA test on English score by race.
```{r}
ggbetweenstats(
  data = exam,
  x = RACE, 
  y = ENGLISH,
  type = "p",
  mean.ci = TRUE, 
  pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, 
  pairwise.display = "s",
  p.adjust.method = "fdr",
  messages = FALSE
)
```

- “ns” → only non-significant
- “s” → only significant
- “all” → everything

## Significant Test of Correlation: ggscatterstats()

In the code chunk below, [ggscatterstats()](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/ggscatterstats.html) is used to build a visual for Significant Test of Correlation between Maths scores and English scores.

```{r}
ggscatterstats(
  data = exam,
  x = MATHS,
  y = ENGLISH,
  marginal = FALSE,
  )
```

## Significant Test of Association (Depedence) : ggbarstats() methods

In the code chunk below, the Maths scores is binned into a 4-class variable by using [cut()](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/cut).
```{r}
exam1 <- exam %>% 
  mutate(MATHS_bins = 
           cut(MATHS, 
               breaks = c(0,60,75,85,100))
)
```
In this code chunk below [ggbarstats](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/ggbarstats.html) is used to build a visual for Significant Test of Association

```{r}
ggbarstats(exam1, 
           x = MATHS_bins, 
           y = GENDER)
```
